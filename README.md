## **🛠 Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have **Python 3.10+** installed. Then, install the required dependencies:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **📂 Setup the Database**  
The database will we automatically setup when you start to use the app :

python main.py
```

This will:  
✔ Create the database (`pharma.db`) if it doesn’t exist.  
✔ Apply the schema from `pharma_schema.sql`.  
✔ **Automatically add users from the provided `.env` file**.

**Modify it manually if necessary.**

| Field      | Value (from `.env`) |
|------------|----------------------|
| Username   | `Ahmad` |
